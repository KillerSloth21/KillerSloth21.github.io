        <h2>Park Ranger at Kenai Fjords (Seward, AK)</h2>
        
         <p>I am a park ranger at Kenai Fjords National Park. My main duty is to ensure the safety of park visitors. But I also encourage responsible recreation within the park.</p>
         <p>
            On my own time I volunteer as a Firefighter/EMT at my local fire department. I also sometimes substitute as the sound man at my local church, Ressurection Bay Baptist Church. I even taught the kids Sunday school once.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy working on cars, hiking, and fishing.
